    <p><strong>42+ Will The Dragon Ball Super Anime Continue Pictures</strong>. Many anime can&#039;t even begin to compete with the dragon ball series i. Dragon ball super is an anime that is the sequel to dragon ball z.</p>

                Also dragon ball super has been a huge sucess worldwide so it doesn&#039;t seem right that the creators would want to stop this series as they have been. However it was not based on a manga by akira toriyama, and is generally not considered canon. Toriyama had only minor involvement in gt (much like the theatrical movies.)

    <h3>After defeating majin buu, life is peaceful once again.</h3>
    <p>When the original dragon ball and dragon ball z anime series were created, they were modest dragon ball as it&#039;s always deserved to be. Complex anime saga continues, as does story&#039;s violence. Read the manga of dragon ball super, the history has more sense. Dragon ball super is over, but a new anime series (or movie) could be on the horizon.</p>
